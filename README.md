# Name of the Project

### Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context 
and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list 
of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there 
are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list 
differentiating factors.

### Table of Contents

### File Structure

### Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include 
screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than 
actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a 
more sophisticated method.

are too long to reasonably include in the README.
