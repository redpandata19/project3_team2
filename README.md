# Name of the Project

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context 
and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list 
of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there 
are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list 
differentiating factors.
## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as 
whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use 
Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions 
for adding a badge.
## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include 
screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than 
actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a 
more sophisticated method.
## Tools Used
pgAdmin4 (DataBase) https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/
JupyterNotebook https://jupyter.org/
QuickDBD https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/
Flask https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/
## Libraries Used

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's 
helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can 
demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they 
are too long to reasonably include in the README.
## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of 
an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list 
them in the README.
## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for 
accepting them.

## Project Status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the 
top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped 
completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step 
in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can 
also make an explicit request for maintainers.^X66xx
